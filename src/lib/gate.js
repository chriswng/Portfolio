// a visitor, so they are unlinked from the site, kept out of the sitemap,
// marked noindex, and asked for a passphrase before they render. That hides
// them from anyone browsing or searching. It is not a lock. The site is a
// static build on GitHub Pages with no server to check anything, this file
// ships to the browser like the rest of the bundle, and the repository behind
// the site is public, so the pages are still there for anyone who has the URL
// and the will to look. Nothing here should be treated as private in the way a
// password on a server would make it private.
//
// To change the passphrase, hash the new one and paste the result below:
//
//   printf '%s' 'the new passphrase' | sha256sum
//
// Changing it invalidates every browser already let in, because what is stored
// is the hash that was accepted and it is checked against this one on the way
// back in.
