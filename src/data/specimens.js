// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// SPECIMENS — the small live charts drawn inside the home page's tool cards
// (src/components/ToolSpecimen.jsx, rendered by src/components/Tools.jsx).
//
// WHY THE NUMBERS ARE COPIED HERE, NOT IMPORTED.
//   Each tool's data module is large: targets is ~128 kB, fashion ~170 kB,
//   footprint ~168 kB. Importing any of them would pull the whole file into
//   the home page bundle for the sake of a handful of numbers, because the
//   exports are single large arrays and there is nothing for the bundler to
//   shake off. So each specimen carries a hand-lifted slice instead.
//
// THE RULE THAT COMES WITH THAT.
//   Every slice below names the file and export it was lifted from, and the
//   figures are read out of that source, never estimated to fit the drawing.
//   When a tool's data changes, its slice here changes in the same commit.
//   `derivedOn` records when the slice was last read across.
//
// Each specimen also carries a `caption` (what the drawing shows) and a
// `basis` (what stands behind it: sourced, derived, or illustrative). The card
// renders both, because a chart with no basis is exactly what the rest of this
// section argues against.
