The land sector also swings the headline from quarter to quarter as estimates are revised, which is why the two numbers are shown together rather than one of them being chosen.',
        'Which release a "per cent below 2005" comes from matters as well. On this national inventory the year to December 2025 is 24.5 per cent below. The Climate Change Authority\'s 2025 Annual Progress Report puts calendar 2025 at 437.5 Mt against a 611.9 Mt 2005 baseline, which is 28.5 per cent below. Both are net of land; the difference is release vintage and baseline convention. Every percentage on this page names its release for that reason, and the chapter above uses the inventory.',
