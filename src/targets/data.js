//   'sourced'    every figure read from a company report or an equivalent
//                published disclosure
//   'partial'    the commitment is sourced but the emissions series has gaps,
//                or part of it is read from a chart label rather than a table
//   'unverified' the commitment is sourced and the emissions series could not
//                be verified, so `reported` is empty and no chart is drawn
// A year that could not be verified is omitted. Nothing is interpolated into
// a reported series, and no claimed line is drawn for a company that has not
// stated an absolute path.
