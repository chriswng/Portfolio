    reasoning: 'Climate Active is a real Commonwealth certification with a public register, and the claim points to a disclosed boundary and the offsets it relies on.

    reasoning: 'Most "vegan leather" is polyurethane, which is plastic made from fossil fuels.

The streaming figure is the Carbon Trust\'s European average for 2020, about 55 g an hour on a 2018-vintage European grid, and the paper itself warns those figures are not designed to be representative of any given scenario, so an Australian hour on a dirtier grid runs higher.
